<h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's
    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer
    protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do

<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
    and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
    comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
    responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<p>We will notify the users via in site notification within 1 business day.</p>
<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a
    right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
    This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
    individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
    processors.
